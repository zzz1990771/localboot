# Demostration Script: Graphical Models and Graphons
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Description:
# This script is designed to generate a variety of networks using
# different graphical models, patterns, and graphon functions. It
# serves as a utility for creating synthetic networks to test
# network analysis algorithms or for simulating complex network
# structures under controlled conditions.
#
# The script will:
# 1. Generate networks based on predefined graphical models.
# 2. Apply different patterns and graphon functions to vary the
#    network structures.
# 3. Save the generated networks for further analysis or use in
#    simulation studies.
#
# This script can be modified to accommodate different network
# sizes, densities, and other characteristics as needed for
# specific research or teaching purposes.

#
# Requirements:
# The script requires the following R packages: 
# - igraph (for network generation and analysis)
# - parallel, foreach (for parallel computation)
# - localboot (this package)
# Install these packages using install.packages() if not already installed.
# Additional files, like real-world network data, should be in the
# specified directory.

# Library Imports
library(igraph)
library(parallel)
library(foreach)
#library(localboot) #currently commented out

# temp source, will be deleted
source('../graph_utils.r')
source('../graph_boot_funs.R')
